# Hybrid Financial Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a hybrid system for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. It leverages **RNN-LSTM** models to capture sequential patterns in transaction data, while **XGBoost**, **Naive Bayes**, and other traditional models serve as benchmarks for performance comparison. The hybrid approach combines the strengths of deep learning and classical machine learning for accurate and reliable fraud detection.

## Features
- Detects fraudulent transactions in real-time or batch mode.
- Uses **LSTM** networks to model temporal dependencies in transaction sequences.
- Benchmarks performance with **XGBoost**, **Naive Bayes**, and other ensemble models.
- Handles imbalanced datasets with techniques like **SMOTE**.
- Provides interpretable insights through feature importance analysis from classical models.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset
- Dataset consists of historical financial transactions with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases.
- Features include transaction amount, timestamp, merchant ID, user ID, and additional engineered features.
- Data preprocessing includes normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

## Architecture / Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding, normalization, handling class imbalance.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Generating meaningful features for model training.
3. **Model Training:** 
   - Deep Learning: RNN-LSTM for sequential fraud detection.
   - Benchmark Models: XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Random Forests.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
